The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

Union:

A union type is a type that can be one of multiple types. When a variable can hold more than one type, union types are used. It is denoted by the | symbol.

Benefits of Union Types
Flexibility: The same function or variable can support multiple types.
Code Readability: TypeScript easily understands which type it is working with.
Type Guards: We can use typeof checks to determine which type we are dealing with.


Intersection:

An Intersection Type is a type that combines multiple types together to create a new type. It is denoted by the & symbol. When using an intersection type, an object must have all the properties of each combined type.

Benefits of Intersection Types

Reusability: It allows you to create a new type by combining multiple types.
Code Structuring: Intersection types let us make an object type more specific and structured.
Alternative to Inheritance: By mixing different interfaces, you can achieve a form of inheritance.
